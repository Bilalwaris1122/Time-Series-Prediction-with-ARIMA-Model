# Time-Series-Prediction-with-ARIMA-Model
This project utilizes the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict future values of a time series dataset. The ARIMA model is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, combining autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to capture and predict patterns in sequential data.
